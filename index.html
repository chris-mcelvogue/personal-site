        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <article>I am an aspiring Software Engineer who just started
          my journed into this new and exciting world. I have always
          loved technology and code but have never taken the leap to try
          and make a career out of it, until now. My journey begins with 
          Flatiron School's flex program for learning Software Engineering.
          This program allows me to continue to work full time while learning
          the necessary skills to change my career and life.

          time, displaying the countdown on the page.
